Version 2.0.1
Finally fixed that bug about spirit lists being confused for a roomjump
list.

Was a stupid one-letter typo that I'm surprised my tools didn't catch.


Version 2.0.0
Ready for a stable release finally.

Underlining names now follows the 'HP Reminder' role in ChatPlus settings.
The popup menu resizes properly now.



Version 1.1.47
Bad uploaded... changed version numbers to make that clear


Version 1.46
Added a 'show offline buddy' option to the Hot list.

This will prolly be the last Beta before releasing this as stable.

As a test I added dashes underlining names in the chat rooms to remind
people they are now active.  Let me know what you guys think.


Version 1.45
Beta release
Fixed the 'Reply' and 'Msg again' buttons in the mail room

Keeping this as a beta for a while longer, just in case...



Version 1.44
Beta release
Although not a lot changed visually, there was a fairly massive internal
rewrite of many ChatPlus's systems.

Noticeable changes:
1)  Buddy List shows up on the Hot List nicely.
2)  You can add/remove buddies from the room chat
3)  You can view home pages or add/remove from the buddy list on the same
menu.
4)  Tails are now picked up from what is in super script.  Much more reliable
and doesn't gag when a person's nickname contains a '@' character.

I was tempted to call this a 2.0.0 release...

Coming soon!  A 'Msg' option to send a nickname to someone's mail room.

Verion 1.42
Bug fixed.  If a realm list was too large, then adding the realm with crash IE.
(9thcork@soi -- part of the city.)



Version 1.1.39
New beta version

Version 1.1.35
Version 1.1.36
Version 1.1.37
Version 1.1.38
Fixed the room detection, then broke it, then fixed it again.
It should stay fixed.

SOI was putting an empty table at the bottom of the HOT list which was causing
a phantom and incomplete row on mine.  Detecting that.

Experimental SeaMonkey support.

BUDDY WATCHER!  Experimental version.  I need feedback about it.

Version 1.1.34
Better handling of realms.  Should properly detect the rooms in more realms now.

Fixed the bug tiny-pet reported about the room ignore code causing things to 
not work under IE.

For those who have 'hide rooms' in SOI enable, the hide/show buttons now show
up on the new hotlist.  The colored backgrounds, at the moment, do not.

Version 1.1.33
Changed version detection code.

Version 1.1.32
Dramatic speed up HOT list display.
(Used documentFragment.
Delayed rendering the non-displayed room links until
needed, since they are not needed most of the time.)


Version 1.1.31
On the HOT list, the checkboxes are now anchored next to the label.  They won't
be orphaned on a line by themselves.  (No-one has complained, but it has been
bugging me since day 1.)

You can now click on the label or the checkbox on the HOT list to toggle.



Version 1.1.30
Tracked down the issue that caused it to forget what version you were running.

Version 1.1.29
Version change to non-beta version.

Version 1.1.28
Avatar manager
A new link on the HOT list says when a realm control was last updated (and gives quick access to the realm control room.)
Nickname preview on the Nickname Screen



Version 1.1.27
Fixed some handling of the 'Reply' button not always working right in the
mail room... the tail was getting corrupted.
 
Some realm-room lists where causing trouble because of blank lines in
the array.  That has now been fixed.


Version 1.1.26
Bug fix test

Version 1.1.25
Added the "empty" rooms to the HOT list.
Added the ability to see rooms that are NOT part of a realm.

Version 1.1.24
Couple of speed tweaks.. most getting rid of some redundant checking.

Version 1.1.23
Added "MSG again" to the mail box.

Ran the code through JSlint until it was happier -- cleaned up a bunch of 
unused variables.

Version 1.1.22
Fixed bug with non-colored names disappearing.

Thank you all for your patience.

Decided to head off any other problems with IE corrupting data and its now 
encoded.  That *SHOULD* get rid of the problem once and for all.

Someone let me know if there are any errors when trying to add a realm!  I don't
think any realms try to pass more than 3K of data, but if so, I need to know.

(Code reformatted and moved around -- organized somewhat from the sloppy hodge
podge it was becoming.)


Version 1.1.21
Worked FINE on my machine.. but not all versions of IE seem to have the same
limit size, so I chopped it *way* down...
Really should be fixed now.

Version 1.1.20
Turns out IE had max length of data it could save which was leading to data
loss.  Should be corrected.


Version 1.1.19
Release Version

Version 1.1.18

For IE:
  Finally found the "*from*" bug -- I'm SURE I've gotten rid of it this time.
  ChatPlus Controls now returns you to the last page you were on.

All:
[HP] links work when reading Cork messages.  Still doesn't work on the cork
message list.



Version 1.1.17
Think I fixed the "chopped off words" problem under some
versions of IE.

Added the "Reply" button in the Mail, but you have to enter a list of names
you are known by.

Got rid of the 'window.prompt' code, replacing it with HTML based.



Ver 1.1.15 IE / Ver 1.1.16 Firefox

Tweaked code to run both under Fx and IE



Version 1.1.15 (BETA)
Re-added version checking when entering ChatPlus control rooms.

Mostly cosmetic changes.

Hidden rooms are now really hid.  Button to show them, should you want to.

Got rid of the last vestages of "innerHTML"



Version 1.1.14 (BETA)
The Control Room is now added to the realm room list it wasn't there.
Some rooms had a dropdown that showed all rooms *BUT* that one.


Verion 1.1.13 (BETA)
Updated version number for release.


Version 1.1.12 (BETA)
Started a 'normal' and Beta version.

If there is a problem with the beta, you can go back to the old version.

Fixed bug of non-citizen handles being flagged for for a home page

Split the Realm Edit screen into two pages.

Added 'RETURN TO ROOM' links, though those are not working 100% correctly.

*** ADDED REAL AUTO-UPDATED REALMS ***
Go to a realm that has a drop-down list -- like
hpcork@soi and notice the new 'Realm' button next to the FIND button.
Click that.  Enter a short name for the realm, then change the realm
description if you'd like.
When you return to hpcork@soi, notice the "Realm" button now reads 
"Realm!", indicating that room is a control room.
The room list is updated whenever you go to the CONTROL room of the realm,
not any other room.


Version 1.1.11
First start of putting in auto-realm detection.

Changed looks of some buttons/links

Fixed bug of data not being passed to the ChatPlus Controls properly.



Version 1.1.10
Catch folks who had a non-container tag in their name.
A weird "<i/>" managed to slip in somehow...
Odd, shouldn't even be POSSIBLE.


Version 1.1.9
More code clean up.
I'm pretty sure I got rid of the two visual problems in the chat room that
were bothering me...

1)  The underline for checking homepages went out too far and bumped against
the said.  Minor, I know, but it annoyed the crap out of me.

2)  The word "*from*" showing up where it shouldn't be and wrecking the
room look, not to mention just plain not working.

However, this came at the cost of not being able to tell who is a citizen and
who isn't, so everyone gets the link.  I have some ideas on how to fix it
but I'll need to play around and see.

(I also noticed that my "[Return to Room]" link that appeared on Homepages
is missing. Hmmmm.  I'll have to look into that.)



Version 1.1.8
Didn't touch the plug-in itself, but I did make some changes in the HTML and
other Javascript to eliminate caching in the ChatPlus control screens.
This should get rid of a bunch of headaches.

So far, the page size is less than a regular SOI page, so I'm willing to 
live with it.


Version 1.1.7
Many, many "under the hood" changes including, unfortunately, a new way of
communicating between the HTML web pages and the plugin.  Required an upgrade
for all users.

Most of the changes were made to make it run under IE using IE7Pro.


Versioin 1.1.2
Added an option under Master Contorls to not show the [HP] at all.

Added an option under Master Controls to underlink all links in a room and
restore the hand icon, over-riding the room designer's choice.

Toned down the HOTLIST table to make it less ... aggressive.

Version 1.1.1
Changed layout of [HP] button to try and make it more visually appealing.

Fixed @yore tail to @my

Delayed screen uploads to window.onload to try to work around Firefox3/Vista
bug of wiping out the chat box on the 'back' button.
